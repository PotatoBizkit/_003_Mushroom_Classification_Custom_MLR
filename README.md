# üçÑ Mushroom Custom Linear Regression

This project explores the **Agaricus-Lepiota mushroom dataset** with a twist: instead of standard off-the-shelf models, it implements a **custom wrapper class** for Simple Linear Regression. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification results with accuracy and confusion matrix.

## What‚Äôs inside
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Custom regression wrapper (`MySLRWrapper`)  
- Feature selection with `SelectKBest`  
- Training & evaluation (accuracy + confusion matrix)  

## Results
The model distinguishes edible vs poisonous mushrooms with unnerving confidence. Makes you wonder if the mushrooms know something we don‚Äôt.  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  

## Disclaimer
This is purely an academic exercise. Please do **not** use this notebook to decide which mushrooms are safe to eat.
